This is a simple plugin to keep the YouTube oEmbed from showing related videos.

== Description ==

WordPress' built-in oEmbed feature is fantastic. I've heard several complaints, though, about the related videos that show up after the video is done playing so I put together this very simple plugin that keeps the YouTube oEmbed code from showing related videos.

On activation, the plugin clears the oEmbed cache so that the videos can be successfully re-cached with the new setting.

== Installation ==

Copy the folder to your WordPress 
'*/wp-content/plugins/*' folder.

1. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin
1. That's it. There's nothing else to do. Really!
